    *   **CTA Button Pulse Animation:** CSS exists (`.cta-button` with `@keyframes pulse`), but animation is currently commented out/disabled in the CSS.
    *   **Video Loop:** Added (`<video>` tag replacing static hero image). (Related to Spec 1.3)

    *   **Text Contrast/Styles:** Implemented via Tailwind classes and custom `.body-text`, `.section-heading` styles in `globals.css`.
    *   **Section Spacing/Dividers:** Implemented (`.page-section` class with `::after` pseudo-element for dividers).
    *   **Background Texture:** Implemented (`.trust-section` class with SVG background).
*   **1.3 Image and Media Enhancements:**
    *   **Carousel Enhancements:** Implemented (Smoother transitions via hook options, active dot styling `.embla__dot--selected:after`).

## Conclusion

The `alt-visual-enhance` branch successfully implements the majority of the planned UI/UX enhancements, significantly improving visual appeal, interactivity, and conversion-focused elements compared to the end state of Phase 3. Key additions include scroll animations, hover effects, enhanced WhatsApp interactions (tooltip, popup, badge, notifications), expandable testimonials, contextual CTAs, anchor navigation, progress bar, and the new image comparison slider. Several iterative refinements based on feedback (logo sizes, text changes, pop-up timings) and necessary build fixes were also completed. The codebase is now ready for further testing (Phase 4).
