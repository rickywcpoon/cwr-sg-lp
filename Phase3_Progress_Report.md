# Phase 3 Development Progress Report: Classic Watch Repair - Singapore Landing Page

**Date:** March 31, 2025
**Status:** Phase 3 Complete (including post-implementation fixes). Ready for Phase 4 (Testing & QA).

## Summary

Phase 3 development, focused on building the functional landing page based on the approved prototype and project brief, is now complete. The core structure, content integration, primary call-to-action (WhatsApp), and basic SEO elements have been implemented in the Next.js project. Post-implementation fixes were applied to address runtime errors, color configuration, and icon rendering.

## Task Breakdown & Progress

**Task 3.1: Code Finalization from Prototype**
*   **Status:** Completed
*   **Actions:**
    *   The base structure from the HTML mockup was translated into JSX within `src/app/page.tsx`.
    *   Custom CSS styles from the mockup were added to `src/app/globals.css`.
    *   Final content elements (Founder's message, Testimonials, Review Summary, HK Workshop mention, Warranty placeholder) were integrated into `src/app/page.tsx`.
    *   Image placeholders (`placehold.co`) were used with descriptive `alt` text.
*   **Relevant Files:** `src/app/page.tsx`, `src/app/globals.css`
*   **Code Snippet (`src/app/globals.css` - Custom Styles):**
    ```css
    /* Custom styles from mockup */
    /* Style for the sticky WhatsApp button */
    .whatsapp-sticky { /* ... */ }
    .whatsapp-sticky:hover { /* ... */ }
    /* ... other icon styles ... */
     .text-warranty-red {
        color: #dc2626; /* Tailwind red-600 */
     }
    ```
*   **Code Snippet (`src/app/page.tsx` - Testimonial Integration):**
    ```jsx
     // Testimonials
      const testimonials = [ /* ... */ ];
      // ... later in JSX ...
      {testimonials.map((testimonial, index) => ( /* ... */ ))}
      <div className="bg-white p-4 rounded-lg shadow text-center">
        <p className="text-lg font-semibold text-brand-gold">Rated 5.0 / 5 Stars</p>
        <p className="text-sm text-gray-500">from 468 Google Reviews</p>
      </div>
    ```

**Task 3.2: Implement WhatsApp Click-to-Chat Functionality**
*   **Status:** Completed
*   **Actions:**
    *   All relevant anchor tags (`<a>`) pointing to WhatsApp, including the sticky button, were updated with the correct `href`: `https://wa.me/85260616572`.
    *   `target="_blank"` and `rel="noopener noreferrer"` were added for external links.
*   **Relevant File:** `src/app/page.tsx`
*   **Code Snippet (`src/app/page.tsx` - Sticky Button):**
    ```jsx
    <a
      id="whatsapp-cta"
      href="https://wa.me/85260616572"
      target="_blank"
      rel="noopener noreferrer"
      className="whatsapp-sticky bg-green-500 hover:bg-green-600 text-white p-4 rounded-full shadow-lg flex items-center justify-center"
      aria-label="Chat on WhatsApp"
    >
      {/* Updated to use Lucide component */}
      <MessageCircle className="icon-whatsapp text-white" aria-hidden="true" />
    </a>
    ```

**Task 3.3: Ensure & Refine Responsiveness**
*   **Status:** Base Implemented (Refinement in QA)
*   **Actions:**
    *   The implementation utilizes Tailwind CSS utility classes derived from the original mockup, which inherently support responsiveness.
*   **Notes:** Comprehensive testing and fine-tuning across specific device breakpoints are recommended for Phase 4 (QA).

**Task 3.4: Implement Basic On-Page SEO Elements**
*   **Status:** Completed
*   **Actions:**
    *   The `metadata` export in `src/app/layout.tsx` was updated with the generated title and description.
    *   Heading tags (H1, H2, H3) were used semantically within `src/app/page.tsx` based on the content structure.
    *   Descriptive `alt` text was added to all image placeholders in `src/app/page.tsx`.
*   **Relevant Files:** `src/app/layout.tsx`, `src/app/page.tsx`
*   **Code Snippet (`src/app/layout.tsx` - Metadata):**
    ```typescript
    export const metadata: Metadata = {
      title: "Classic Watch Repair Singapore | Expert Vintage Watch Service & Restoration",
      description: "Trusted vintage & classic watch repair in Singapore via NAXO drop-off. Expert HK workshop handles complex restorations, band repairs & servicing. Get a free WhatsApp consultation!",
    };
    ```

**Task 3.5: Prepare for QA Review**
*   **Status:** Completed
*   **Actions:** All development tasks for Phase 3, including post-implementation fixes, are complete. The code in `src/app/page.tsx`, `src/app/globals.css`, and `src/app/layout.tsx` represents the functional landing page ready for testing.

## Post-Implementation Fixes & Refinements

Following initial testing with `npm run dev`, several adjustments were made:

1.  **Runtime Error Fix:** Added `"use client";` directive to the top of `src/app/page.tsx` to resolve errors related to using event handlers (`onError` for image placeholders) in Server Components.
2.  **Tailwind Color Configuration:** Updated `src/app/globals.css` to correctly define custom brand colors (`brand-navy`, `brand-gold`, etc.) within the `@theme inline` directive and set the default `font-family` to 'Inter'. This resolved issues where custom color classes were not being applied.
    *   **Code Snippet (`src/app/globals.css` - Theme Update):**
        ```css
        @theme inline {
          --color-background: var(--background);
          --color-foreground: var(--foreground);
          --font-sans: "Inter", sans-serif; /* Use Inter font */
          --font-mono: var(--font-geist-mono);

          /* Add custom brand colors */
          --color-brand-navy: #1a2a4a;
          --color-brand-gold: #b48c5a;
          --color-brand-light: #f8f8f8;
          --color-brand-gray: #e5e7eb;
        }
        /* ... */
        body {
          /* ... */
          font-family: var(--font-sans); /* Use the defined sans font */
        }
        ```
3.  **Icon Implementation:** Replaced external `<img>` tags for icons (which were not rendering correctly) with imported React components from the `lucide-react` library (`npm install lucide-react`). CSS filters were removed from icon classes in `src/app/globals.css` as colors are now applied directly via Tailwind text classes.
    *   **Code Snippet (`src/app/page.tsx` - Icon Import & Usage):**
        ```jsx
        import {
          Watch, Settings, Wrench, Sparkles, MessageSquareText, MapPin, CheckCircle, PackageCheck, ShieldCheck, MessageCircle
        } from 'lucide-react';
        // ...
        <Watch className="icon-block text-brand-gold" aria-hidden="true" />
        // ...
        <MessageSquareText className="icon-step text-white" aria-hidden="true" />
        // ... etc.
        ```

## Image Placeholder Mapping

The following `placehold.co` URLs were used. These should be replaced with final assets during or after QA.
