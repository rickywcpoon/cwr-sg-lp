# Active Context: CWR Singapore Landing Page

**Date:** (Auto-populated on update)

## 1. Current Work Focus

*   Verifying the LCP fix implementation.
*   Updating the Memory Bank.

## 2. Recent Changes / Analysis

*   Reviewed project structure (from `latest_structure.md` and file tree).
*   Analyzed `src/app/layout.tsx`: Identified root setup, metadata, font loading (Geist), GTM integration, and basic preloading.
*   Analyzed `src/app/page.tsx`: Mapped out sections, identified state variables (`isHeaderVisible`, `isPopupVisible`, `isReviewModalOpen`), analyzed numerous `useEffect` hooks responsible for dynamic behaviors.
*   Analyzed components (`ImageCompareGallery`, `ImageCompareSlider`, `BeforeAfterCarousel`, `ImageModal`): Understood their purpose.
*   Noted the use of Tailwind CSS, TypeScript, Next.js App Router, and Lucide icons.
*   Identified client-side rendering focus (`"use client"`) and associated patterns.
*   **Verified LCP Fix:** Confirmed the hero section video was replaced with a prioritized `next/image` component using the poster, with the video lazy-loaded via state (`shouldLoadVideo`) and a `useEffect` hook (timeout trigger).
*   Addressed build error by removing unused `PlayCircle` import.
*   Updated WhatsApp links to the Singapore number.
*   Documented WhatsApp widget functionality (though file was subsequently deleted).

## 3. Next Steps

*   Await further instructions or tasks from the user.

## 4. Active Decisions & Considerations

*   **Memory Bank Structure:** Adhering to the user's defined structure and content requirements for the Memory Bank files.
*   **Information Synthesis:** Extracting key information about product goals, tech stack, and system patterns from the provided code and documentation.
*   **Performance Strategy:** Successfully applied the strategy of changing the LCP element from video to a prioritized static image.

## 5. Important Patterns & Preferences (Learnings)

*   **Emphasis on Trust & Expertise:** The landing page heavily focuses on building user trust and highlighting CWR's specialized skills.
*   **Interactive UX:** Significant effort invested in dynamic UI elements.
*   **Clear Conversion Path:** Multiple CTAs consistently drive users towards WhatsApp consultation.
*   **Component-Based Structure:** Adherence to React component model.
*   **Client-Side Logic:** Most dynamic functionality is handled client-side within `page.tsx` using hooks.
*   **LCP Optimization:** Prioritizing static images over heavy media (like autoplaying video) for the initial paint is critical for LCP.

## 6. Project Insights

*   The project successfully translates a service offering reliant on remote expertise into a locally accessible service for Singaporeans through a partnership.
*   Addressing user concerns proactively is a key part of the content strategy.
*   Visual proof (before/after gallery) is crucial for demonstrating value.
*   Client-side interactivity can significantly impact performance metrics like LCP if not managed carefully (e.g., via lazy-loading heavy components/media).
