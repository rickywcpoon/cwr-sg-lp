# Product Context: CWR Singapore Landing Page

## 1. Why This Project Exists

Classic Watch Repair (CWR), a renowned Hong Kong-based watch repair service with specialized expertise (especially in vintage Rolex and complex restorations), wants to expand its reach to the Singapore market. This landing page serves as the primary digital storefront to introduce CWR's services to Singaporeans, build trust, and facilitate service inquiries through a local partnership.

## 2. Problem Solved

*   **For Customers:** Provides Singapore-based owners of valuable/vintage watches access to world-class repair expertise that might be unavailable locally or that other service centers might refuse due to complexity or age. Offers a trusted, transparent process with convenient local drop-off (via NAXO Timepiece) despite the workshop being in Hong Kong.
*   **For CWR:** Creates a dedicated channel to attract and convert customers in the lucrative Singapore market, leveraging their established reputation and specialized skills.

## 3. How It Should Work (User Experience)

*   **Discovery:** Users (likely arriving from ads or organic search) land on a page that immediately conveys expertise, trustworthiness, and the Singapore connection.
*   **Information:** The page clearly presents CWR's unique selling points (vintage expertise, band restoration, handling complex repairs), addresses common concerns (trust, parts, process), and visually showcases their work (before/after).
*   **Process Clarity:** The partnership with NAXO Timepiece and the HK workshop process is explained simply and transparently.
*   **Trust Building:** Testimonials, Google reviews, founder message, and guarantees reassure users.
*   **Conversion:** Multiple, clear Calls-to-Action (CTAs) prompt users to initiate a WhatsApp consultation at various points in their journey.
*   **Interaction:** Smooth animations, intuitive navigation (anchor links), interactive elements (gallery, modal, expandable text), and timely prompts (popups, notifications) enhance engagement without being intrusive.
*   **Accessibility:** The page should be easy to use and understand on all devices (desktop, mobile, tablet).

*   **Clarity:** Users should easily understand what CWR offers, why they are unique, and how the service process works.
