# Progress: CWR Singapore Landing Page

**Last Updated:** (Auto-populated on update)

## 1. Current Status

*   **Overall:** A functional landing page exists, implementing the core sections and features outlined in the project brief.
*   **Memory Bank:** Initialized and updated to reflect recent changes.
*   **Performance:** LCP performance issue addressed by implementing an image-first loading strategy for the hero section.
*   **Build:** Build errors related to Tailwind CSS resolution and unused variables have been fixed.

## 2. What Works

*   **Core Structure:** Landing page sections are present and structured.
*   **Layout & Styling:** Root layout is functional, Tailwind CSS provides styling.
*   **Components:** Key custom components (`ImageCompareGallery`, `ImageModal`) are implemented and used.
*   **Interactivity:** Scroll animations, sticky header/nav, WhatsApp integration, expandable testimonials, notifications, Google Reviews modal, scroll progress bar are functional.
*   **Integrations:** Google Tag Manager is integrated.
*   **Performance:**
    *   Basic optimizations (image optimization, font loading, script loading, throttling) are included.
    *   **LCP improvement strategy implemented (hero video replaced by prioritized poster image, video lazy-loaded via timeout).**
*   **Build Process:** Project builds successfully after fixing dependency and linting issues.

## 3. What's Left to Build / Refine

*(Based on initial analysis, potential areas for future work)*

*   **UI Primitives (`src/components/ui/`):** Verify and potentially implement/utilize common UI components (Button, Card, etc.), possibly leveraging shadcn/ui.
*   **`BeforeAfterCarousel`:** Decide whether to implement/uncomment this component or remove it.
*   **Code Refinement:** The large number of `useEffect` hooks in `page.tsx`, especially those performing direct DOM manipulation, could potentially be refactored.
*   **Hero Video Load Trigger:** Refine hero video loading trigger (currently 2.5s timeout, consider interaction, scroll threshold, or `requestIdleCallback` for better UX/performance).
*   **A/B Testing:** Implement A/B testing framework if required.
*   **Content Updates:** Populate/Refine content based on ongoing requirements.
*   **Error Handling:** Enhance error handling.
*   **Testing:** Implement unit, integration, or end-to-end tests.
*   **Detailed Accessibility Audit:** Perform a more thorough accessibility check.

## 4. Known Issues

*   None explicitly identified. Potential for refinement in `page.tsx` complexity and video load trigger exists.

## 5. Evolution of Project Decisions

*(To be documented as the project progresses)*

*   **Initial:** Decision to use Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS.
*   **Initial:** Choice of specific components for image display.
*   **Initial:** Implementation of numerous interactive features via `useEffect` in `page.tsx`.
*   **Initial:** Integration with GTM.
*   **Initial:** Partnership model with NAXO for SG drop-off.
*   **Performance:** Addressed slow LCP by replacing the initial hero video render with a prioritized static image and lazy-loading the video.
*   **Build:** Resolved build failures by reinstalling dependencies and removing unused code identified by ESLint.
