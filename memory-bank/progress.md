# Progress: CWR Singapore Landing Page

**Last Updated:** (Auto-populated on update)

## 1. Current Status

*   **Overall:** A functional landing page exists, implementing the core sections and features outlined in the project brief.
*   **Memory Bank:** Initialized based on code analysis (as of this update).

## 2. What Works

*   **Core Structure:** Landing page sections (Hero, Concerns, Solution, Process, Trust, etc.) are present and structured in `page.tsx`.
*   **Layout & Styling:** Root layout (`layout.tsx`) is functional, Tailwind CSS provides styling, and basic responsiveness seems implemented.
*   **Components:** Key custom components (`ImageCompareGallery`, `ImageModal`) are implemented and used. `BeforeAfterCarousel` exists but is currently commented out.
*   **Interactivity:**
    *   Scroll-triggered animations (`animate-on-scroll`) are implemented.
    *   Sticky header/anchor navigation logic is functional.
    *   WhatsApp integration (CTA button, timed popup, tooltip, social proof badge) appears functional.
    *   Expandable testimonials feature is implemented.
    *   Recent contact notifications are functional.
    *   Google Reviews modal display is functional.
    *   Scroll progress bar is implemented.
*   **Integrations:** Google Tag Manager is integrated via `next/script`.
*   **Performance:** Basic performance considerations (image optimization, font loading, script loading, throttling) are included.

## 3. What's Left to Build / Refine

*(Based on initial analysis, potential areas for future work)*

*   **UI Primitives (`src/components/ui/`):** Verify and potentially implement/utilize common UI components (Button, Card, etc.), possibly leveraging shadcn/ui (inferred from `components.json`).
*   **`BeforeAfterCarousel`:** Decide whether to implement/uncomment this component or remove it.
*   **Code Refinement:** The large number of `useEffect` hooks in `page.tsx`, especially those performing direct DOM manipulation, could potentially be refactored for better separation of concerns or using more React-idiomatic patterns (e.g., Refs where appropriate).
*   **A/B Testing:** Implement A/B testing framework if required (suggested by `ab_test_plan_hero_copy.md` in `pm_files`).
*   **Content Updates:** Populate/Refine content based on ongoing requirements.
*   **Error Handling:** Enhance error handling, especially around API calls or third-party scripts (if any are added later).
*   **Testing:** Implement unit, integration, or end-to-end tests.
*   **Detailed Accessibility Audit:** Perform a more thorough accessibility check.

## 4. Known Issues

*   None explicitly identified during the initial analysis. Potential for refinement in `page.tsx` complexity exists.

## 5. Evolution of Project Decisions

*(To be documented as the project progresses)*

*   **Initial:** Decision to use Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS.
*   **Initial:** Choice of specific components for image display (Gallery, Slider, Modal, Carousel).
*   **Initial:** Implementation of numerous interactive features via `useEffect` in `page.tsx`.
*   **Initial:** Integration with GTM.
*   **Initial:** Partnership model with NAXO for SG drop-off.
